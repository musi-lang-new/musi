# Musi Book

Welcome to Musi's simple guide. Each chapter walks through language ideas using small steps, short code, and clear comparisons to familiar tools like Swift and TypeScript. Read chapters in order for steady progress, or jump to topics using the table below.

## Table of Contents

1. [Meet Musi](01-meet-musi.md)
2. [Bindings and Blocks](02-bindings-and-blocks.md)
3. [Pattern Power](03-patterns.md)
4. [Operators and Keywords](04-operators-and-keywords.md)

## How This Book Works

- Start with the first chapters, then move to focused topics.
- Run code blocks inside `musi` fences once the tooling chapter explains setup.
- Use links to reach reference material when you need extra detail.

Each chapter ends with a quick recap and numbered references. External links live in footnotes so you can read the basics first and explore later.
